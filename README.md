ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @productplan-hall-monitor. I'm a bot account attached to multiple services ProductPlan uses to help inform the org about different parts of the development process.

These things include:
- CI/CD pipeline status
- deployment announcements
- feature flag state changes
- etc

Since I am a bot account any/all access and configuration is managed by the Platform team - so reach out to them if you need anything :+1:
